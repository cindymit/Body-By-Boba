## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: I definitely think I understand React enough to be able to build an app with it. I can set up my jsx files as needed and import necessary files and tools. In terms of complexity, I can definitely meet the minimum requirement for setting up a functional app.

### Weaknesses: I get thrown for a loop when I am asked to incorporate new array methods (e.g. React-And-Array-Methods HW) or in the most recent case, working in ES6 classes. In order to overcome this, I am revisiting the class repos and lab code-alongs.

### Opportunities: I would like to take the oppurtunity to use this project to showcase more complexity in my coding. For example, I am incorporating pre-determined options for base, milk, topping, and sugar percentage in a drop down menu as opposed to an empty input box.

### Threats: Time management will definitely be a threat for me this week. I will do my best to allocate a certain amount of time to a singular part of my project. I will also reach out for support in a timely fashion, especially if I have been taking too long trying to resolve certain errors.
